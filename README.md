# Axis Joystick Library

For Arduino ant STM32 boards.

The Library implements a set of methods for working with an axis
joystick controller.
Dual axis XY joystick module reading.

The Analog Joystick is similar to two potentiometers connected together,
one for the vertical movement (Y-axis) and other for the horizontal
movement (X-axis). The joystick also comes with a button.

The Arduino Uno or any other Arduino board that uses Atmega328 as
the Microcontroller has ADC resolution of 10 bits. Hence the values on each
analog channel can vary from 0 to 1023.
The STM32 board has ADC resolution of 12 bits. Hence the values on each analog
channel can vary from 0 to 4095.

The home position for the stick is at (x,y:511,511, for Arduino).
If the stick is moved on X axis from one end to the other, the X values will
change from 0 to 1023 and similar thing happens when moved along the Y axis.
On the same lines you can read position of the
stick anywhere in upper half hemisphere from combination of these values.

## Installation

1. [Download](https://github.com/YuriiSalimov/AxisJoystick/releases) the Latest release from gitHub.
2. Unzip and modify the Folder name to "AxisJoystick" (Remove the '-version')
3. Paste the modified folder on your Library folder
(On your `libraries` folder inside Sketchbooks or Arduino software).
4. Restart the Arduino IDE.

        RIGTH - X-axis is pressed right;
